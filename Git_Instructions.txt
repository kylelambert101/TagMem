I associated this project with its own git repository, as well as a linked backup repository in Dropbox. 

After updating files, open a terminal window to the project location and type

	git status
	
This will display all differences between the working directory and the repository. Type

	git commit -a -m '<commit message>'
	
This will commit all files with the commit message <commit message> -- for a multiline message, end the command at -a

Typing 'git status' again should show that the local repository has been updated, but the "origin" repository in Dropbox is behind. 

To update the Dropbox repository, type

	git push
	
After that, everything should be good to go.
